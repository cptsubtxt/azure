## Part I: Manage identities and governance in Azure

### Configure Microsoft Entra ID

#### Describe Microsoft Entra concepts

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/configure-azure-active-directory/3-describe-azure-active-directory-concepts

Azure AD concept Description
Identity An identity is an object that can be authenticated. The identity can be a user with a username and password. Identities can also be applications or other servers that require authentication by using secret keys or certificates. Microsoft Entra ID is the underlying product that provides the identity service.
Account An account is an identity that has data associated with it. To have an account, you must first have a valid identity. You can't have an account without an identity.
Microsoft Entra account An Azure AD account is an identity that's created through Microsoft Entra ID or another Microsoft cloud service, such as Microsoft 365. Identities are stored in Microsoft Entra ID and are accessible to your organization's cloud service subscriptions. The Microsoft Entra account is also called a work or school account.
Azure tenant (directory) An Azure tenant is a single dedicated and trusted instance of Microsoft Entra ID. Each tenant (also called a directory) represents a single organization. When your organization signs up for a Microsoft cloud service subscription, a new tenant is automatically created. Because each tenant is a dedicated and trusted instance of Microsoft Entra ID, you can create multiple tenants or instances.
Azure subscription An Azure subscription is used to pay for Azure cloud services. Each subscription is joined to a single tenant. You can have multiple subscriptions.

#### Compare Active Directory Domain Services to Microsoft Entra ID

Identity solution: AD DS is primarily a directory service, while Microsoft Entra ID is a full identity solution. Microsoft Entra ID is designed for internet-based applications that use HTTP and HTTPS communications. The features and capabilities of Microsoft Entra ID support target strong identity management.

Communication protocols: Because Microsoft Entra ID is based on HTTP and HTTPS, it doesn't use Kerberos authentication. Microsoft Entra ID implements HTTP and HTTPS protocols, such as SAML, WS-Federation, and OpenID Connect for authentication (and OAuth for authorization).

Federation services: Microsoft Entra ID includes federation services, and many third-party services like Facebook.

Flat structure: Microsoft Entra users and groups are created in a flat structure. There are no organizational units (OUs) or group policy objects (GPOs).

Managed service: Microsoft Entra ID is a managed service. You manage only users, groups, and policies. If you deploy AD DS with virtual machines by using Azure, you manage many other tasks, including deployment, configuration, virtual machines, patching, and other backend processes.

#### Select Microsoft Entra editions

Free, Microsoft 365 Apps, P1, P2

#### Create group accounts

Security Group, Microsoft 365 Apps

Access rights Description
Assigned Add specific users as members of a group, where each user can have unique permissions.
Dynamic user Use dynamic membership rules to automatically add and remove group members. When member attributes change, Azure reviews the dynamic group rules for the directory. If the member attributes meet the rule requirements, the member is added to the group. If the member attributes no longer meet the rule requirements, the member is removed.
Dynamic device (Security groups only) Apply dynamic group rules to automatically add and remove devices in security groups. When device attributes change, Azure reviews the dynamic group rules for the directory. If the device attributes meet the rule requirements, the device is added to the security group. If the device attributes no longer meet the rule requirements, the device is removed.
